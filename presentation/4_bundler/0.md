Bundler (1/2)
=============

Gemfile and Gem management
--------------------------

Librairies are called gem and there is a tool to manage them, called `Rubygems`.

Put all needed gems in the *Gemfile* and run `bundle install` to install them.

*Gemfile:*

    !ruby
    # Make sure to decleare at least one 'source'
    source 'http://rubygems.org'

    # Bundler requires these gems in all environments
    gem "rails"
    gem 'exception_notification'
    #gem "prototype-rails" Will be needed with Rails3.1
    gem "db_populate"
    gem "rubyzip"

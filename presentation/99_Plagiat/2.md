=====================
Ant ?
------
Apache Ant is a software tool for automating software build processes. It is
similar to Make but is implemented using the Java language, requires the Java
platform, and is best suited to building Java projects.

The most immediately noticeable difference between Ant and Make is that Ant
uses XML to describe the build process and its dependencies. By default the XML
file is named build.xml.

Be careful with external linking

- Available on different kind of OS ? (Unices such as GNU/Linux and MAC OS X,
  Microsoft Windows)
- Is it still maintened ?

Pro tip

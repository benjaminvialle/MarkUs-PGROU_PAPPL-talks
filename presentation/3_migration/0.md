Migrations (1/3)
================

Load schema in database
-----------------------

`Ruby on Rails` will load the schema in the database (the backend doesn't matter) with `bundle exec rake db:schema:load`.


Populate the database with fake datas
-------------------------------------

You can also populate the database with students, graders, admin, assignments with `bundle exec rake db:populate`. Take a look at *db/populate/\*.rb* files.

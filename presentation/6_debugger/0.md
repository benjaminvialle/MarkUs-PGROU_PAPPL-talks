Debugger (1/2)
================

Breakpoint
-----------

Just put the word `debugger` in a portion of code called by RoR

*app/controllers/sections_controller.rb:*

    !ruby
    def index
      @sections = Section.find(:all)
    end

*became:*

    !ruby
    def index
      debugger
      @sections = Section.find(:all)
    end

*In your terminal:*

    !shell
    Completed 200 OK in 853ms (Views: 536.6ms | ActiveRecord: 91.5ms)
    /mnt/data/MarkUs/Markus/app/controllers/sections_controller.rb:11
    @sections = Section.find(:all)
    (rdb:1)

State of the art
------------------
Some annoying bugs remain before releasing 1.0.0

Ask your mentors ;-) --> Benjamin V., Nelle V.

Interesting files
--------------------

- Look at models related to assignments and students (*app/models*)
- Look at migrations to create new fields (and/or tables) in database (*db/migrate*)
- Look at routes (*config/routes.rb*)
- Database schema (on the wiki and generated with railroady)
- Model schema (generated with railraody)

*Generating diagrams*:

    !bash
    bundle exec rake rake -T
    bundle exec rake diagram:all

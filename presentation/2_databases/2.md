Databases (3/4)
================

Interact with database
---------------------------------

Create the database with `bundle exec rake db:create`, the load the schema with `bundle exec rake db:schema:load`.

You can also populate the database with faked datas (very usable for development) : `bundle exec rake db:seed`

By default, Rails will focus on development environment : it is the development database that will be created. To work with other modes; consider using the RAILS_ENV=production or RAILS_ENV=test variable before each bundle statement.
